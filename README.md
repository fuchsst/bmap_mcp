# BMAD MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol ([MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)) Server that exposes the [BMAD](https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD) (Breakthrough Method of Agile AI-driven Development) methodology as standardized tools for AI systems.

## Overview

The BMAD MCP Server bridges the proven BMAD methodology with the broader AI ecosystem through the Model Context Protocol standard. It enables any MCP-compatible AI system to leverage structured project development workflows including:

- **Project Planning**: Generate project briefs and comprehensive PRDs.
- **Architecture Design**: Create technical and frontend architectures.
- **Story Management**: Generate and validate development-ready user stories.
- **Quality Assurance**: Run BMAD checklists and validation tools.

## Features

- üîß **9 BMAD Tools**: A comprehensive toolkit for AI-driven development.
- üöÄ **CrewAI Integration**: Powered by collaborative AI agents for complex reasoning.
- üì° **Dual Transport**: Supports both stdio (for local clients) and Server-Sent Events (SSE for web-based clients).
- ‚úÖ **Template Compliance**: All generated artifacts adhere to BMAD methodology templates.
- üîç **Built-in Validation**: Quality checks using BMAD checklists ensure high-quality outputs.
- üê≥ **Docker Ready**: Easy deployment and scaling with Docker and Docker Compose.

## Documentation

For detailed setup, configuration, usage examples, and development workflow, please refer to our full [**Documentation**](./docs/index.md).

## Quick Start (Docker Recommended)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bmad-project/bmad-mcp-server
    cd bmad-mcp-server
    ```
2.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Copy the example environment file and edit it with your API keys:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Open .env and add your LLM API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, AWS Bedrock)
    ```
3.  **Run with Docker Compose:**
    *   For SSE mode (recommended for most clients):
        ```bash
        docker-compose up bmad-mcp-server
        ```
        The server will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.
    *   For stdio mode:
        ```bash
        docker-compose up bmad-mcp-stdio
        ```

For local installation without Docker, see the [Getting Started](./docs/getting-started.md) guide in our documentation.

## Available Tools (Summary)

### Project Planning Tools

- **`create_project_brief`** - Generate structured project briefs
- **`generate_prd`** - Create comprehensive PRDs with epics and stories
- **`validate_requirements`** - Check PRDs against PM quality standards

### Architecture Tools

- **`create_architecture`** - Generate technical architecture documents
- **`create_frontend_architecture`** - Design frontend-specific architectures
