# Welcome to the BMAD MCP Server Documentation

The **BMAD MCP Server** empowers AI systems to leverage the [BMAD (Breakthrough Method of Agile AI-driven Development)](https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD) methodology. By exposing BMAD processes as standardized tools via the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), this server enables AI assistants like Cline, Claude Code, and GitHub Copilot to participate actively in structured project development workflows.

This documentation provides comprehensive guidance on setting up, configuring, and utilizing the BMAD MCP Server to enhance your AI-assisted development practices.

## Key Features

-   **BMAD Methodology as Tools**: Access core BMAD processes for planning, architecture, story management, and quality assurance directly through your AI assistant.
-   **CrewAI Integration**: Leverage sophisticated AI agent orchestration for complex tasks like PRD generation and architectural design.
-   **Flexible Transport**: Connect via stdio for local setups or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for broader network access.
-   **Standardized Artifacts**: Ensure consistency with BMAD templates and quality standards for all generated documents.
-   **Docker Support**: Deploy and manage the server easily using Docker and Docker Compose.
